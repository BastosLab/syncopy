Welcome to Syncopy's Documentation!
===================================

Syncopy (Systems Neuroscience COmputing in Python) is a Python toolkit for
user-friendly, large-scale electrophysiology data analysis. The goals of the
project are:

1. Syncopy provides a fully *open source* Python environment for reproducable
   electrophysiology data analysis.
2. Syncopy is *scalable* for large datasets. It automatically makes use of the
   available computing resources by being developed with built-in parallelism.
3. Syncopy is *compatible* with the MATLAB toolbox FieldTrip.
