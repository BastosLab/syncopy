Systems Neuroscience Computing in Python
========================================

Syncopy is going to be a user-friendly analysis toolkit for large-scale
electrophysiology data. The goals of the project are:

1. *Syncopy is* a *fully open source* Python environment for electrophysiology
   data analysis 
2. *Syncopy is scalable* for large datasets. It will automatically make use of the
   available computing resources by being developed with built-in parallelism 
3. *Syncopy is compatible with Fieldtrip*: 
    - data and results can loaded into MATLAB and Python
    - parameter names and function call syntax are as similar as possible
